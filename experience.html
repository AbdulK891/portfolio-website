          <h3 class="role-title">Python Developer Intern | Altech Power and Energy Systems Private Limited | February 2023 – May 2023</h3>
          <p class="role-desc">
            ▪	Designed and implemented two next-word prediction models—one leveraging a patented in-house orientation vector algorithm and the other using traditional n-gram methods—to assess scalability, efficiency, and predictive accuracy across varying dataset sizes<br>
            ▪	Benchmarked both models by comparing prediction accuracy, inference speed, and storage efficiency; discovered that the orientation vector model reduced storage by ~35% and improved accuracy by ~20% on datasets over 1 million tokens<br>
            ▪	Presented detailed performance trade-offs showing that the in-house model achieved 2x faster inference speeds on large datasets while underperforming on smaller ones, influencing model optimization decisions for future deployments
